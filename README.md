# SvxLink Builder Ansible Role
This Ansible role is used to build a package from Git source code. This package
is not meant to be distributed on its own since it lacks some desirable
features. The generated package is meant to be used with the svxlink-runner
Ansible role to install SvxLink on multiple nodes. The package should be looked
upon as sort of an advanced tar archive.
